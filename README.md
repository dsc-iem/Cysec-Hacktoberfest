# Cybersecurity Hacktoberfest repository

**This repository contains two very basic  programmes one of which is focused on ``networking`` while other on </br> a very beginner yet very important vulnerability ``information gathering``**

</br>

***Key Logger***

`Key logger, often referred to as keystroke logger or keyboard capture, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly ,so that person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. A key logger can be a software or a physical device we will be making one such software in this directory.`


***Know_Your_IP***

`IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers that are typically displayed in dotted decimal notation. A 32-bit address contains two primary parts: the network prefix and the host number. All hosts within a single network share the same network address. Each host also has an address that uniquely identifies it. IPv4 addresses are also classified into 5 different classes.`

***Reverse Shell***

`A Reverse Shell is a common tool used by attackers to take control of a victim machine. The attacker listens for incomimng connection requests as the victim tries to connect back to it. The attacker can now execute various tasks on the remote victim achine like Spawning a shell , taking a screenshot , uploading and downloading files, etc.`

***MITM Over ARP***

`The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.The ARP protocol lacks any authentication mechanism which allows for performing Man-In-The-Middle Attacks.

***Morsecode Encoder_Decoder***

`Morsecode Encoder_Decoder is a basic tool which can decode any morse string into simple plain text and encrypt any plain text into morsecode. Morsecode is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs.`
